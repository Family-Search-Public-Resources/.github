## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue. Include as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue.

**Steps for Reporting Bugs:**

2. If not, create a new issue. Include:
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   - A detailed description of the problem.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Screenshots or code snippets, if applicable.
   - Environment details (e.g., browser version, operating system, etc.).

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for improvements to our tools, data, and resources. Please submit your idea by opening an issue and using the **Enhancement** template.

**Steps for Suggesting Enhancements:**
1. Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/family-history-research/issues) to see if your suggestion has been made.
2. If not, open a new issue with the following details:
   - A descriptive title.
   - A clear description of the enhancement and why it would be useful.
   - Any relevant examples or use cases.

### Contributing Code

If you'd like to contribute code (fixing a bug, adding a feature, etc.), follow these steps:

**1. Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to the repository you want to contribute to.
   - Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy.

**2. Create a Branch:**
   - Create a new branch on your forked repository for your contribution.
   - Name the branch something descriptive, such as `fix-bug-123` or `add-new-feature`.

### 3. Make Your Changes:
- Write clear, readable, and well-commented code.
- If you’re fixing a bug, try to include a test case that covers the issue.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request:
- Once you’re done with your changes, commit and push them to your fork.
- Open a pull request from your branch to the original repository’s `main` branch.
- In your pull request description, include the issue number it resolves (if applicable), a brief description of your changes, and any important details for reviewers.

### Pull Request Checklist:
- Ensure the code passes existing tests and linting.
- Document your changes if necessary (in the README, code comments, etc.).
- Reference related issues in your pull request description (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- Tag the PR with the appropriate labels (e.g., bugfix, enhancement).
