# Let's Get Started!

The world of family history and genealogy is a vast one and, for many newcomers it can be quite overwhelming. Not to worry, this page will show you lots of ways that you can get started with a variety of family history research activities from starting your very own family tree, to learning cool stories about your family line, to using computer vision to digitize and index millions of documents. There are no shortage of places to start with this incredible work.

## Start Your Own Family Tree!

A great place to start with family history research is with your own family! Maybe you already know some of your more immediate relatives or maybe not. Either way here are a few steps to get you started:

1. Create a [Family Search](www.familysearch.org) account.
2. Gather what information you can about your immediate geneology. Try to get the names and birthdates of everyone from your parents to your great-grandparents. Don't be shy to ask family members what they remember!
3. Add this informatino to your family tree in Family Search

## Get Involved With Indexing!

Indexing is when people transcribe information from historical documents and digitize them so that more people's ancestors can be found. This helps add new historical documents to our ancestors helping to learn more about them and what their lives may have been like. It also helps connect people today with those who came before. Additionally, it is a crucial step in making sure that historical records of people are accurate and up to date.

Family Search has made this process much easier recently. They even have computer vision resources that help scan and digitize historical records while only needing humans to verify the information it has found.
