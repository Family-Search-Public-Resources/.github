## Why is Family History Important?

Genealogy is about discovering the powerful stories that have shaped our lives. The story of the world is a story of families. In a time when people seem to be ever more divided, our collective story is a tool that can bring us together. When we learn about our ancestors, and with them the history of the world, we gain a special ability to connect with ourselves and with others. With the tools and resources here, you can uncover mighty things about your family history. Ready to get started? Explore our repositories and start your journey today!
